Hi :wave:

I am Aakansha, a FOSS Enthusiast (Free and OpenSource Enthusiast). I love deep-diving into the Internals of Javascript and the Web. I am a core maintainer of [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), [mermaid-to-excalidraw,](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw) [react-tags](https://github.com/react-tags/react-tags), and more libraries.

I am a volunteer at [FOSSUnited](https://fossunited.org/) and I lead the FOSS Meetups in Bangalore. I am an active conference Speaker.

As I am an Independent OpenSource developer, I rely on sponsorships to sustain my FOSS work, if you are interested in backing my opensource efforts, you can take a look at my [sponsorship profile](https://github.com/sponsors/ad1992) 🙏

If you would like to discuss something, just drop me an [email](mailto:aakansha1216@gmail.com) :)
